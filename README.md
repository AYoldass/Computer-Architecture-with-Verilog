This repo contains my studies on Computer Architecture. These studies have been tested on INTEL ALTERA FPGA card.


Assignment 1 --> Counter -Debouncer

Assignment 2 --> Ripple Carry Adder

Assignment 3 --> Serial Adder

Assignment 4 --> Karatsuba Multiplier

Assignment 5 --> FIFO

Assignment 6 --> UART

Assignment 7 --> BORON Algorithm

Assignment 8 --> ALU

Assignment 9 --> Single Cycle Core

Assignment 10 --> Multi Cycle Core


While implementing these projects, max-min delay calculations, timing analyses, state machines, instruction types and working principles have been applied.
